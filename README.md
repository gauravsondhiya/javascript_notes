Core JavaScript Concepts

# Data Types and Variables

Primitive and reference types (e.g., strings, numbers, objects, arrays).
var, let, const keywords and their scopes.

# Functions
Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
Default parameters, rest parameters, and spread operator.
Higher-order functions and callbacks.

# Objects

Creating and manipulating objects.
Object methods, this keyword, and prototypes.
Object destructuring and property shorthand.

# Closures

Persistent data with closures.
Definition and use-cases.
Practical examples in real-world scenarios.



# DOM Manipulation

Selecting and modifying DOM elements.
Event listeners and delegation.
Handling user inputs and form validations.

# ES6+ Features

let and const, template literals.
Modules (import/export).
Classes and inheritance.
Iterators and generators.

## Advanced JavaScript

# Execution Context and Scope

Global and local scope.
Hoisting and Temporal Dead Zone.

# Prototype and Inheritance

Prototypal inheritance.
Understanding __proto__ and prototype.

# Event Loop and Concurrency

Callbacks, promises, and async/await.
Event loop phases.

# Memory Management

Garbage collection.
Common memory leaks.

# Error Handling

try-catch blocks.
Custom error creation.

# Performance Optimization

Debouncing and throttling.
Lazy loading and code splitting.

# JavaScript in the Browser

# Browser APIs

LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and Cookies.
Fetch API and AJAX.
Geolocation, Web Workers.

# Event Propagation

Event bubbling and capturing.
Stopping propagation.

# Cross-Origin Communication

CORS basics and solutions.


# Data Structures

Arrays (methods like map, filter, reduce, etc.).
Sets, Maps, and WeakMaps.
Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists (basic).

# Algorithms

Sorting and searching algorithms.
String manipulation.
Recursion basics.
